# Get it started. Paypal ExpressCheckout.

In this chapter we are going to talk about the most common task: purchase of a product using [Paypal ExpressCheckout](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/express-checkout).
We assume you already read [get it started](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Core/Resources/docs/get-it-started.md) from core.
Here we just show you modifications you have to put to the files shown there.

## Installation

The preferred way to install the library is using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
Run composer require to add dependencies to _composer.json_:

```bash
php composer.phar require payum/paypal-express-checkout-nvp
```

## config.php

We have to only add the payment factory. All the rest remains the same:

```php
<?php
//config.php

use Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\PaymentFactory as PaypalExpressPaymentFactory;
use Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\Api;

$paypalExpressCheckoutFactory = new \Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\PaymentFactory; 
$payments['paypal_express_checkout'] = $paypalExpressCheckoutFactory->create(array(
   'username'  => 'change it',
   'password'  => 'change it',
   'signature' => 'change it',
   'sandbox'   => true,
));
```

## prepare.php

Here you have to modify the `paymentName` value. Set it to `paypal_express_checkout`.
