Payum Paypal ExpressCheckout Nvp
================================

The lib implements [Paypal Express Checkout](https://www.x.com/content/paypal-nvp-api-overview) payment.

## How to capture?

```php
<?php
use Buzz\Client\Curl;

use Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\Api;
use Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\PaymentFactory;
use Payum\Request\CaptureRequest;
use Payum\Request\RedirectUrlInteractiveRequest;

{{testo:Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\Examples\ReadmeTest::doCapture}}
```

You can also capture digital goods:

```php
<?php
{{testo:Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\Examples\ReadmeTest::doDigitalGoodsCapture}}
```

## Was the payment finished successfully?

```php
<?php
use Payum\Request\BinaryMaskStatusRequest;

{{testo:Payum\Paypal\ExpressCheckout\Nvp\Examples\ReadmeTest::doStatus}}
```

## Want to store payments somewhere?

There are two storage supported out of the box. [doctrine2](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Bridge/Doctrine/Storage/DoctrineStorage.php)([offsite](http://www.doctrine-project.org/)) and [filesystem](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Storage/FilesystemStorage.php).
The filesystem storage is easy to setup, does not have any requirements. It is expected to be used more in tests. 
To use doctrine2 storage you have to follow several steps:

* [Install](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/installation.html) doctrine2 lib. 
* [Add](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/configuration.html#obtaining-an-entitymanager) mapping [schema](src/Payum/Paypal/ExpressCheckout/Nvp/Bridge/Doctrine/Resources/mapping/PaymentInstruction.orm.xml) to doctrine configuration. 
* Extend provided [model](src/Payum/src/Payum/Paypal/ExpressCheckout/Nvp/Bridge/Doctrine/Entity/PaymentInstruction.php) and add `id` field.
